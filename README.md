# 3D-engine
Windows console 3D engine based on the olcConsoleGameEngine.
For now, this is really just a different implementation of Javidx9's console graphics engine making use of some C++ specific features like operator overloading. More features will be added soon.
All credits for the olcConsoleGameEngine go to Javidx9.
